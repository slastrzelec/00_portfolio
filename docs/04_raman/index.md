# 🔬 Raman Spectroscopy Analysis Tool

## ✨ Overview

The **Raman Spectroscopy Analysis Tool** is a comprehensive web application built with Streamlit and advanced scientific Python libraries (like Pandas, NumPy, and potentially SciPy/LMFIT) designed for chemists, materials scientists, and engineers to quickly and accurately process, analyze, and characterize Raman spectroscopy data, particularly focusing on **carbonaceous materials** (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes).

It streamlines the entire workflow from raw data import to quantitative material property extraction, eliminating the need for complex desktop software.

📈 Some Some screenshots from application:

#### 🔍 Peak Detection Visualization
The "Peak Detection" screen displays the results of automatic peak identification within a Raman spectrum (example for CNT-COOH_c.txt). The overlaid interactive Plotly chart visualizes 11 detected peaks (marked with a red 'X'), based on defined parameters such as Minimum height (0.15) and Prominence (0.08).

#### 📊 Loaded Spectrum Overview
The **"Data Overview"** screen serves as the analysis starting point. It displays **metadata** for the loaded file (e.g., CNT-COOH\_c.txt), including the **number of data points** (7070), the **Wavenumber Range** (603.2 - 3400.0 cm^{-1}), and the minimum and maximum intensity values. The **"Data validation passed"** section confirms that the data format is correct before commencing the processing workflow.

#### 📈 Spectrum Normalization Comparison
The **"Preprocessing"** tab allows you to select a normalization method. The screenshot shows a comparison of the original spectrum (left, blue) with the normalized spectrum (right, green) using the **Min-Max** method. This method scales intensities to the range [0, 1], which is crucial for sample comparison and ensuring data consistency for peak detection algorithms.


## 🛠️ Key Features and Workflow

The application implements a full-featured spectroscopy workflow across several tabs:

* **Data Handling:** Supports easy upload of single or multiple `.txt` files with Wavenumber and Intensity columns. Includes data **validation** and metadata extraction.
* **Preprocessing:** Essential steps to prepare spectra for analysis:
    * **Baseline Correction:** Algorithms including **Linear (Endpoints)** and **Asymmetric Least Squares (ALS)** to remove fluorescence background. 
    * **Normalization:** Methods like Min-Max, Max-Intensity, Area, and Vector (L2) normalization for comparison.
    * **Smoothing:** Optional Savitzky-Golay filtering to reduce noise.
* **Peak Analysis:** Automated detection and categorization of Raman bands (suchowo **D, G, RBM, 2D bands** for carbon materials). Calculates fundamental peak statistics.
* **Quantitative Fitting & Deconvolution:** Advanced fitting using **Lorentzian** or **Gaussian** models for precise deconvolution of overlapping bands (e.g., D and G bands). This allows calculation of critical ratios.
* **Material Characterization:** Calculates key material parameters based on fitting results, such as:
    * The **$I_D/I_G$ ratio**, crucial for determining defect density/crystallinity.
    * The **$I_{2D}/I_G$ ratio**, critical for characterizing the number of graphene layers.
* **Visualization & Export:** Interactive plots (Plotly) at every stage of the pipeline and the ability to export final results.
